## Development Guidelines

### ESLint Rules

> Linting not only looks for code that may potentially break, but also forces the developer to write cleaner code in a more consistent style. We are using *vue-cli-plugin-eslint* and linting can be configured in *.eslintrc* in root directory.
You can follow [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) for more information.
